# Snake Assignment | OO&FP

We use Gradle as our build system. 

## Getting Started in IntelliJ IDEA

IDEA is smart enough to configure the Gradle project correctly.

- To begin, ``File->Open...`` the downloaded/cloned skeleton 
- A gradle icon should appear in your rightmost side tab bar
    - All the tasks listed under ``Tasks`` there 
    - Click on any one of them to run
    - This will also add a 'play button' configuration to the top right toolbar

## ``gradlew`` | Using the Gradle Wrapper

For other text editors or IDEs you may simply interact
with Gradle through the command line.

### Running

``./gradlew run``

### Testing

``./gradlew test``

## Handing In

``./gradlew submit``

- This should open up a dialog asking for your vunet id
- The zipped source file should be in the ``build`` directory
- Please upload this zip to Canvas
